# Try to give a rough estimate of the maximum memory usage
# expected from a given instance of MySQL or Percona Server.
#
# THIS IS KNOWN TO BE INACCURATE; there are some uses of memory by
# mysqld that aren't represented by this formula.
#
# There are also some figures (join_buffer_size, tmp_table_size) that
# might be allocated more than once per thread, depending on the query.
#
# So you can use the formula to give you a reminder of some (but not all)
# of the potential consumption of memory in mysqld.
