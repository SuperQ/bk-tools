# Export-slow-log-table
#
# You can log queries to a table instead of a file in MySQL.
# But most tools that analyze the log only work on the file type logging.
# This script connects to a MySQL instance (possibly a remote instance)
# and dumps the entries of the slow-query log table in the format of
# the regular flat-file slow-query log.  Then you can use standard tools
# such as pt-query-digest on the exported file.
#
# NOTE: Query_time in the table-log is rounded down to an integer, as
# the nearest whole second.  This reduces the precision of query times
# so you really should use file-based logging if you can.
